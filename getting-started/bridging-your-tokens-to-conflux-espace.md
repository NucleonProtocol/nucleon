# 4âƒ£ Bridging Your Tokens to Conflux eSpace

{% hint style="info" %}
_Conflux Network supports bridging assets from other networks and from Conflux Core Space._&#x20;

_To bridge your assets to Conflux eSpace, you'll first need to fund you Conflux eSpace wallet to be able to pay for **gas** and claim your bridged assets._
{% endhint %}

To get CFX on Conflux eSpace, you'll need to either:    &#x20;

* [Transfer it from Conflux Core Space](http://link-pending/), using the Fluent Wallet bridge. Bridging assets from Conflux Core Space is free.  &#x20;
* [Transfer it from KuCoin](http://link-pending/), which lists native eSpace CFX (not wrapped). &#x20;

See the [Transferring Assets to Conflux eSpace](http://link-pending/) section for more information.&#x20;
