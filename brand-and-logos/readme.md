## Intro

Please be sure to read these guidelines first before using any brand assets.&#x20;

Although Nucleon distributes some of its technology under open-source licenses, the Nucleon, XCFX and NUT brands are not distributed under the same licenses.&#x20;

The following Nucleon "Brand Assets" are copyrighted material, and you may only use them in accordance with the policy detailed below:&#x20;

* The Nucleon, XCFX and NUT logos, word mark, icon&#x20;
* The Nucleon name
* Other visual assets produced by Nucleon

## What you may do

You may use Nucleon's Brand Assets when you are:&#x20;

* Referring to our products and services&#x20;
* Linking to our official site or products, such as "Liquid Staking on Nucleon"
* Announcing an official partnership, but only if you have official approval by a qualified member of the Nucleon team&#x20;

For information on other uses of our Brand Assets, please reach out at ****&#x20;

## **What you may not do**

We firmly believe in the open-source ethos of Web3 but protecting the Nucleon brand is extremely important for our users' security, so that users know what a genuine product/endorsement is and what isn't.&#x20;

Here are a few examples of forbidden uses of our Brand Assets:&#x20;

* Don't use our Brand Assets in your products' name, logo, NFTs, etc. &#x20;
  * For example, making an app called " Nucleon CAR" or "NUT BIKE" are not allowed.&#x20;
  * Don't use the Nucleon logo in whole or in part as part of your products' logos, marketing material, website, or other.&#x20;
  * Logos with a strong resemblance to the Nucleon Icon are also forbidden.&#x20;
* Don't use our Brand Assets to create digital or physical products for sale, including but not limited to&#x20;
  * Merchandise ("Swag")&#x20;
  * NFTs&#x20;
  * Other products&#x20;
* Don't create derivative names that imply official endorsement&#x20;
* For example, don't make a social media group called " Nucleon Spain" - this sounds official. " Nucleon Fans of Spain" may be permitted.&#x20;
* Don't change or adapt our Brand Assets in any way&#x20;
  * Use the logos and other assets exactly as provided. Do not change the colors, reassemble, abbreviate, or change these assets in any way.&#x20;
