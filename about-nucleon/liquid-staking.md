# Liquid Staking

Liquid staking protocols allow users to earn staking rewards without locking assets or maintaining staking infrastructure. Users can deposit tokens and receive tradable liquid tokens in return. The contract stakes these tokens using elected staking providers. As usersâ€™ funds are controlled by the contract, staking providers never have direct access to the users' assets.

Staking on Conflux requires expert knowledge and complex and costly infrastructure. There are several reasons why - the main being the fact that slashing and offline penalties can get very severe if the staking is managed improperly. In addition to this, self-staking brings with it a minimum deposit of 1000 CFX and a token lock-up about 14 days.

Through the use of a liquid self-staking service such as Nucleon, users can eliminate these inconveniences and benefit from secure, non-custodial staking backed by industry leaders.
