# Overview

Nucleon is a liquid staking solution for Conflux PoS backed by industry-leading staking providers. Nucleon lets users stake their CFX- without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure.

Our goal is to solve the problems associated with Conflux PoS staking - illiquidity, immovability and accessibility - making staked CFX liquid and allowing for participation with any amount of CFX to improve security of the Conflux network.

### How does Nucleon work ?

When staking with Nucleon, users receive xCFX tokens on a 1:1 basis representing their staked CFX. xCFX balances can be used like regular CFX to earn yields and lending rewards, and are updated on a daily basis to reflect your CFX staking rewards. Note that there are no lock-ups when staking with Nucleon, and have minimum deposits of 1 CFX to decrease DDoS risks.

When using Nucleon, staking rewards will be compound  in real-time, allowing for participation in the securing of Conflux without the associated risks and downside potential.
