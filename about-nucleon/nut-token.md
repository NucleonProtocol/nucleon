# NUT Token

NUT( NUCLEON Token) is an ERC20 token granting governance rights in the NUCLEON. The Nucleon DAO governs a set of liquid staking protocols, decides on key parameters (e.g., fees) and executes protocol upgrades to ensure efficiency and stability. By holding the NUT token, one is granted voting rights within the DAO. The more NUT locked in a user’s voting contract, the greater the decision-making power the voter gets. The NUT can be used to mint XVIP NFT Card, which enables noble services such as an addition coefficient for decision-making power. The total amount of NUT is 300 K, 200K are issued when you use the NUCLEON and 100K are held by the DAO to distribute the initial LP across decentralized finance products.

NUT can be obtained via farming, by providing liquidity on AMM DEX Swappi. To claim revenue (50% of Service Vault) by staking NUT, the platform has a vested staking approach: NUT staked for 1-month (10% of the deserved income), NUT staked for 2-month (20% of the deserved income), NUT staked for 3-month (40% of the deserved income), NUT staked for 6-month (60% of the deserved income), and NUT staked for 12-month (100% of the deserved income). If the vested time is not completed, there will be a penalty.
