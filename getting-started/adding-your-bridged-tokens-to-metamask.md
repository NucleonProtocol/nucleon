# 5âƒ£ Adding Your Bridged Tokens to MetaMask



Once you bridge your tokens, you'll need to import (or add) the bridged tokens to your wallet so that you're able to see the balance of tokens your account and transact with them. By default, most wallets (including MetaMask) do no show them.&#x20;

Adding tokens to Nucleon is super simple. To add a token:&#x20;

1. Go to Nucleon.&#x20;
2.  Expand Select a token to open the Select a token dialog.
