# Customer Support

There is NO customer support for Nucleon. If you're experiencing issues,&#x20;

1. First check the [**General FAQ**](../get-help/general-faq.md). &#x20;
2. If you can't find a solution, try reaching out to your local Telegram group. &#x20;

Admins will NEVER send you a direct message. If anybody approaches you directly on e.g. Telegram pretending to represent customer support, please block them and report it as spam.&#x20;

**NEVER, under any situation, should you ever give someone your private key or recovery phrases. Immediately block and report anyone that asks for them.**&#x20;
