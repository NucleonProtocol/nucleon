# 1⃣ Choosing a Wallet

To get started with Nucleon, the first thing you’ll need is to set up a wallet that supports Conflux eSpace. We recommend using one of the supported wallets for interacting with Nucleon.&#x20;

#### Supported Wallets&#x20;

Nucleon currently supports [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Fluent Wallet](http://fluentwallet.com/) and [Wallet Connect.](https://walletconnect.com/)&#x20;

You can also user your Ledger device with Nucleon through MetaMask or Wallet Connect. Refer to Using Your Ledger Hardware Wallet with Nucleon to learn how.&#x20;
